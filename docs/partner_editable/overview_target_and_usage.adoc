This guide provides instructions for deploying the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start into Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS).

This Quick Start is for developers, DevOps, security teams, and any role within an organization that builds, deploys, and maintains applications on Amazon EKS. It sets up a resource-monitoring architecture using Grafana open-source monitoring and observability software. Grafana allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and explore your metrics no matter where they are stored. It provides you with tools to turn your time-series database (TSDB) data into graphs and visualizations.
